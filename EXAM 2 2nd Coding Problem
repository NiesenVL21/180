# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Step 1: Load the dataset
file_path = r'C:\Users\NiesenVL21\Downloads\Restaurant Revenue.xlsx'
restaurant_data = pd.read_excel(file_path)

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Since we're doing multiple regression, we'll select the relevant columns as features and target
features = ['Number_of_Customers', 'Menu_Price', 'Marketing_Spend', 'Average_Customer_Spending', 'Promotions', 'Reviews']
target = 'Monthly_Revenue'

# Step 3: Splitting features and target
X = restaurant_data[features]
y = restaurant_data[target]

# Step 4: Adding constant term for intercept
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Step 5: Fitting the regression model
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

# Step 6: Displaying regression summary
print(model.summary())

# Step 7: Predicting monthly revenue
# You can input your own values for the features to predict monthly revenue
# For example:
new_data = {
    'const': 1,
    'Number_of_Customers': 1500,
    'Menu_Price': 15,
    'Marketing_Spend': 2000,
    'Average_Customer_Spending': 20,
    'Promotions': 1,
    'Reviews': 100
}
new_data_series = pd.Series(new_data)
predicted_revenue = model.predict(new_data_series)
print("Predicted Monthly Revenue:", predicted_revenue)
